üî∑ Core Azure Networking Concepts
1.	Virtual Network (VNet)
o	Subnets, address spaces, and IP ranges
o	VNet peering (intra-region and global)
2.	Network Security Groups (NSGs)
o	Inbound/outbound rules
o	Associating NSGs with subnets or NICs
3.	Azure Firewall & Route Tables
o	Custom routes (UDR)
o	Firewall rules and integration
4.	Azure Load Balancers
o	Basic vs Standard
o	Internal and external load balancing
o	Load balancing rules and health probes

üîê Connectivity and Security
7.	VPN Gateway
o	Point-to-site and site-to-site VPNs
o	ExpressRoute (dedicated private connection to Azure)
8.	Application Gateway
o	Layer 7 load balancing
o	Web Application Firewall (WAF)
9.	Azure Front Door
